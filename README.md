# Computer_Vision_Basic_Image_Operations
In this assignment we will learn the basics of image manipulation using histograms and lters. Although MATLAB has many built in functions, our goal
is to learn image processing through doing things ourselves.
 The assignment requirements are described in the pdf file named Ex1 - BASIC IMAGE OPERATIONS. 
 The MATLAB code file is named Ex1.m. The final assignment report is described in the pdf file named NA-311394357_CM-208491787.
